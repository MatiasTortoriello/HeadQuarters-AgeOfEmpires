Additionally, they get +3 attack out of Tusk Swords which lifts their attack to levels only the Elite War Elephant sits in. Their cavalry department in general is fairly usable, too, but they are missing key traits such as the Paladin, which is why the Battle Elephant is usually the cavalry unit of choice.

Put all together, these units form a very threatening and very mobile force. This also works great with their excellent siege weapons which also receive a great speed boost thanks to Drill. Outside these areas of expertise the Mongols fare rather poorly. Their other archers and cavalry units miss important upgrades at the Blacksmith. The infantry, however, is solid despite missing the Halberdier and Supplies. On the water, the lack of Dry Dock is really unfortunate since it means their ships miss out on an important speed boost.
